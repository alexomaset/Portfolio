        <h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
        <p>Software development has always been my interest for as long as I can remember, from the time I was young I always strived to navigate through the basic windows 98 tools and applications and build simple things. Then I came across the term “Hello World” back in highschool, These two simple words challenged me to explore further and discover more about programming so I decided to go for an IT course in campus but still I wasn't satisfied, on my quest to learn more on software development I joined Moringa school within the past 6 months building on HTML,CSS,Javascript and Python while building real applications and working on team projects. The blended learning at Moringa school provides adequate skills in approaching and solving problems by building systems from scratch, I worked as a backend developer in a team of five people to build a full-scale application that addresses and aids victims of gender based violence. The team faced a few technical difficulties especially during the market research because the topic is sensitive, but eventually managed to finish the application on time incorporating all the features based on the feedback we got, being positive its gonna make a difference and curb the problem at hand.</p>
